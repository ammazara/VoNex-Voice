# VoNex – Nigeria’s Smart Virtual Number Service

### Product Overview
VoNex is a communication platform inspired by Google Voice, designed for Nigerians who want a **single smart number** to call, text and manage voicemail across all their devices; anytime, anywhere.

### Why It Matters
In Nigeria, many people juggle multiple SIMs and phone numbers due to poor network coverage and high call costs. VoNex solves this by giving users **one cloud-based number** that works across all devices, networks, and locations.  
It simplifies personal and business communication while reducing dependency on physical SIM cards.

- **Small businesses** needing a unified customer contact line  
- **Travelers & expatriates** who want to stay reachable without roaming fees  
- **Everyday users** tired of network switching and SIM swaps 


### Key Features
- One number for all calls, texts, and voicemails  
- Number linking across devices (mobile, web, tablet)  
- Custom voicemail greetings & transcription  
- Affordable local and international calling  
- Call forwarding and contact management dashboard  
- Secure cloud-based communication  

### Technologies (Planned)
- **Frontend:** React.js (responsive web interface)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (API services)  
- **Database:** MongoDB (user data & message storage)  
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth / OAuth  
- **Cloud Services:** Twilio API for calls & messaging, AWS for hosting  

### Vision
VoNex aims to make communication borderless, reliable, and affordable; starting with Nigeria. By bridging telecom and internet layers, it enables a new era of **virtual telephony** for the world.
